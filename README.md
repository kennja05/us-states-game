# us-states-game

Alona Matokhina and Jacob Kenny

This Repo will use the folliwng repo for the backend: https://github.com/alyon4a/us-states-api

*Background
 
The United State of America is made up of 50 individual states. These states vary greatly in size, population, climate,    location, political leanings, and many other factors. Some enthusiastic people seemingly know everything there is to know about these 50 states, and some know very little. There's nothing wrong with either, but is it such a bad thing to learn more about the country in which you are living?

*Purpose

The goal of this project is to reinforce the user's knowledge about the locations of the 50 United States. Additionaly, we've included information about these states such as state capital, nickname, and a hand-selected image representing the state to so that more than just geography is covered.
